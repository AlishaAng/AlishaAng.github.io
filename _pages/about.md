I am Alisha Angdembe, a Data Scientist/Researcher at the William Harvey Research Institute, Queen Mary, University of London. I am a part of Queen Mary's [Digital Environment Research Institute (DERI](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/deri/). Since 2021, I have been ivolved in the [AI-Multiply consortium](http://ai-multiply.co.uk/who-we-are/), where I analyse large electronic health record datasets to understand long-term conditions and polypharmacy.

I have experience in analysing large electronic health records (EHRs), including those from the [Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD)](https://www.cprd.com). I am interested in using EHRs to gain meaningful insights and identify patterns that can contribute to improving healthcare outcomes.
