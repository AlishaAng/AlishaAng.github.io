About me
========

I am Alisha Angdembe, a Data Scientist/Researcher at the William Harvey Research Institute, Queen Mary, University of London, specializing in AI applications for healthcare. Since 2021, I have been part of the AI-Multiply consortium, where I analyse large electronic health record datasets to understand long-term conditions and polypharmacy.

I have experience in analysing large electronic health records (EHRs), including those from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD). I am interested in using EHRs to gain meaningful insights and identify patterns that can contribute to improving healthcare outcomes.
