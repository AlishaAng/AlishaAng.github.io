**Researcher analysing large-scale electronic health records (EHR)** within the **AI-MULTIPLY consortium**, a UK-wide collaboration applying artificial intelligence to understand **multiple long-term conditions (MLTC)** and **polypharmacy**.

> William Harvey Research Institute, Queen Mary University of London (2021-03 — present)

## My Contributions
- **Analysed the EHR data** from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD), covering millions of patients across the UK.  
- Applied **machine learning**, **AI**, and **survival analysis** methods to model multimorbidity trajectories, medication patterns, and patient outcomes.  
- Worked in an **interdisciplinary team** with clinicians, pharmacists, computer scientists, and data managers to design and interpret analyses.  
- Communicated findings and progress effectively through consortium meetings, presentations, and written reports for diverse audiences.  
- **Engaged with patients and the public (PPIE)** in workshops on AI and ensuring patient perspectives informed project priorities.  
- Contributed to academic publications.  
- **Supervised and mentored MSc students**, providing guidance on data science methodology, reproducible research, and EHR-based analysis.
