Topic: Building Trust for Meaningful Engagement. 

As a panel speaker, I shared insights on how early career researchers can build trust and foster meaningful Public and Patient Involvement (PPI) in research. I discussed what effective engagement looks like, the outcomes it can achieve, and how Iâ€™ve adapted my approach to make PPI more impactful and inclusive. My talk emphasized practical ways to strengthen researcher-participant collaboration for better research outcomes.
